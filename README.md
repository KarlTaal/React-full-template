## Project summary    
Template for future projects. Includes react page that communicates with the database through the backend. To view and add content to the database you have to be logged in. You can log in, log out and register a new user. Supports multiple user logins, for example, from two different browsers.
The database is not included. Will need to create it manually beforehand.

Front-end: **ReactJS**    
Back-end: **Flask**    
Database: **PostgreSQL**    
Authentication: **JWT Token based**
